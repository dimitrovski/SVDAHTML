    <b><h2>THE STIG</h2></b>
    <ol><b>The Stig</b> is a character on the British motoring television show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)">Top
            Gear</a>. The character is a play on the
        anonymity of racing drivers' full-face helmets, with the running joke that nobody knows who or what is inside
        the Stig's racing suit. The Stig's primary role is setting lap times for cars tested on the show. Previously,
        he would also instruct celebrity guests, off-camera, for the show's "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment.

        The identity of the original "Black" Stig, Perry McCarthy, was exposed by a Sunday newspaper in January 2003,
        and confirmed by McCarthy later that year. The black-suited Stig was subsequently "killed off" that October in
        the series 3 premiere, and replaced in the following episode by a new White Stig who lasted through to the end
        of series 15.

        In series 13 episode 1, the show jokingly unmasked the Stig as seven-time world champion F1 driver Michael
        Schumacher. In the hiatus following series 15, racing driver Ben Collins was revealed to be the Stig in a court
        battle over Collins' impending autobiography, titled The Man in the White Suit. In series 16, debuting in
        December 2010, Collins was replaced by a second White Stig, whose identity has so far remained secret.</ol>

        <h3><b>Creation and name</b></h3>
    </ol>
    <ol>The idea for the character was part of former host Jeremy Clarkson's and producer Andy Wilman's concept for the
        relaunched Top Gear show, bringing a new format to the original version of Top Gear which ceased production in
        2001. The relaunched show introduced a live studio audience, the Stig, a racetrack, and madcap stunts.
        Clarkson is credited by the Sunday Times with having come up with the original idea for the Stig.

        Clarkson and Wilman wanted to have a professional racing driver as part of the show's cast, but ran into
        difficulty finding a driver sufficiently adept at speaking on-camera. Clarkson then asked Wilman why the driver
        needed to speak at all, and they decided that the Stig's role would be silent.

        The name Stig derives from Wilman and Clarkson's time at Repton School, where new boys had always been called
        "Stig". According to the original Stig, Perry McCarthy, speaking in 2006, the producers had wanted the
        anonymous driver to be called "The Gimp", referring to the use of gimp suits in BDSM sexual role-playing. After
        McCarthy objected, they settled upon the name Stig. McCarthy had said of the idea at the time that "I don't
        want to be forever remembered as the Gimp".</ol>
    <h2>Introductions</h3>
    The Stig's introductions on the show have underlined his oddness. Initially the presenters heralded his appearance
    with simple humorous introductions, such as "His Holiness, the Stig!" Beginning in series 6, the
    introductions began to follow a format of, "Some say that [two bizarre characteristics]. All we know is, he's
    called the Stig." Characteristics described in this format include:
    <h3>He has no face</h3>
    <h3>He is teriffied of Scouts</h3>
    <h3>The drinks cabinet in his car contains 14 different types of custard</h3>
    <h3>His favourite T-shirt has a picture of a T-shirt</h3>
    <h3>He is afraid of bells</h3>\
    <h3>He is confused by stairs</h3>
    <h3>He never blinks</h3>
    <h3>He naturally faces magnetic north</h3>
    <h3>He has a digital face</h3>
    <h3> He will charge you if you attempt to remove his helmet.</h3>
